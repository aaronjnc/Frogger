I created a 3D version of Frogger within Unreal Engine 5.3. This project starts with the basic Frogger level in 3D, with the cars, turtles, and logs to jump across. Then the second level adds a higher platform that you must jump across eagles to the lily pads to win the game.

Controls:
W/S - Hop forwards/backwards
A/D - Slowly strafe left/right
Space - Hold for a larger jump
Mouse - look around
1 - Switch to level 2
